                 The wide distributions of switching voltages in unipolar switching currently pose major obstacles
                 for scientific advancement and practical applications. Using NiO capacitors, we investigated the
                 distributions of the reset voltage and current. We found that they scaled with the resistance value Ro
                 in the low resistance state and that the scaling exponents varied at Ro ⬇ 30 ⍀. We explain these
                 intriguing scaling behaviors and their crossovers by analogy with percolation theory. We show that
                 the connectivity of conducting filaments plays a crucial role in the reset process. © 2008 American

             Unipolar RS is widely accepted to occur because of the
       formation and rupture of conducting filaments under an elec-
       tric field.1 The switching voltage distributions may be closely
       related to the connection and disconnection of the conduct-
       ing filaments. To describe collective changes in the conduct-
       ing filaments’ connectivity, we recently developed a new
       type of percolation model: the random circuit breaker 共RCB兲
       network model.4 This model was able to explain the revers-
       ible dynamic processes observed in the unipolar RS. The
       resulting percolating cluster was highly directional, unlike
       the nearly isotropic infinite cluster of classical percolation
       theory. However, our recent experimental work using third
       harmonic generation demonstrated that the connectivity of
       the conducting filaments in the unipolar RS could be quite
       similar to that in classical percolating systems.5
             Here, we investigate how the percolating conducting
       filaments could become ruptured in the low-to-high RS,
       called the reset. In the unipolar RS, we show that the switch-
       ing voltage and current scale with the resistance in the low
       resistance state 共LRS兲. Depending on the resistance, there are
       two scaling regimes. We discuss the crossover between the
       two regimes in terms of the internal cluster structure of per-
       colating filaments.                                                          FIG. 1. 共Color online兲 100 current-voltage 共I-V兲 curves from seven NiO
